# Contributing

Contributions to Verifyica are both welcomed and appreciated.

The project uses an GitHub Flow branching strategy.

- `development` branch for active development / unreleased code
- `release-<VERSION>` branches for releases.

Release branch code is considered "**locked**" except for documentation changes.

- [Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless) is used to apply [Palantir Java Format](https://github.com/palantir/palantir-java-format)
- PMD is used for static analysis
- Expand all Java imports
- Tags are used for releases

For changes, you should...

- Fork the repository
- Create a branch for your work off of `development`
- Make changes on your branch
- Build and test your changes
- Open a pull request targeting `development`, tagging `@antublue` for review
- A [Developer Certificate of Origin](DCO.md) (DCO) is required for all contributions
